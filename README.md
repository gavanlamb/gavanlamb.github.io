## workflows
### Pull request raised
[pull-request.opened.yml](.github/workflows/pull-request.opened.yml)  

This workflow will run on every `opened` and `reopened` pull requests.

This workflow exists because reviewing pull requests have an overhead to the review process where information is not readily available. This workflow aims to provide the reviewer with the necessary information to make an informed decision as well as help the developer automate work that is repetitive and time consuming.

It will:
1. Checkout the code
2. Try and get the jira issue details from the branch name - please see [action.yml](https://github.com/gavanlamb/github-actions/blob/main/.github/actions/jira/get-issue-details/action.yml) for more information
3. Update the Jira issue status to `Review` - please see [action.yml](https://github.com/gavanlamb/github-actions/blob/main/.github/actions/jira/change-issue-status/action.yml) for more information
4. Update the pull request title and the description with the following variables: - please see [action.yml](https://github.com/gavanlamb/github-actions/blob/main/.github/actions/pull-request/update-pr/action.yml) for more information
   * `{{ISSUE_IDENTIFIER}}`: the Jira issue identifier. This value is retrieved from the `issueIdentifier` input parameter.
   * `{{ISSUE_TITLE}}`: the Jira issue title. This value is retrieved from the `issueTitle` input parameter.
   * `{{ISSUE_URL}}`: the Jira issue url. This value is retrieved from the `issueUrl` input parameter.
   * `{{REPOSITORY_NAME}}`: name of the github repository. This value is retrieved from the context property `${{ github.repository }}`.
