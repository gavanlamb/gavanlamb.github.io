## workflows
### Pull request raised
[pull-request.opened.yml](.github/workflows/pull-request.opened.yml)  

This workflow will run on every `opened` and `reopened` pull requests.

This workflow exists because reviewing pull requests adds an overhead to the review process because information is not readily available. This workflow aims to provide the reviewer with the necessary information to make an informed decision as well as help the developer automate work that is repetitive and time consuming.

It will:
1. Try and get the Jira issue details from the branch name - please see [action.yml](https://github.com/gavanlamb/github-actions/blob/main/.github/actions/jira/get-issue-details/action.yml) for more information
2. Update the Jira issue status to `Review` if the task is of type `subtask` - please see [action.yml](https://github.com/gavanlamb/github-actions/blob/main/.github/actions/jira/change-issue-status/action.yml) for more information
3. Update the pull request title and the description with the following variables: - please see [action.yml](https://github.com/gavanlamb/github-actions/blob/main/.github/actions/pull-request/update-pr/action.yml) for more information
